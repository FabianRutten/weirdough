                        <h2>How it started</h2>
                        <p>This restaurant started with a shared love for cookies. We wanted to create a place where you could buy and eat cookies, so we could share our love with the rest of the world. This idea would prove to be the start of a long and intense journey, that took us to all outskirts of the world in a search for perfection, and that eventually culminated in this restaurant. So take a look at the menu because we have something for everyone, and we hope we will see you soon!</p>

                        <h2>How we make our cookies</h2>
                        <p>We here at Weirdough think our customers deserve the most delicious cookies possible. That's why we have made it our mission to obtain the highest quality ingredients and use the most cutting-edge cooking techniques, and combine those two to make the best cookies you have ever tasted.</p>
                        <p>Our process starts by working closely together with our business partners to select the finest of ingredients. These ingredients are then shipped as fast as possible to our restaurant, to make sure they are still fresh when the cooking begins. Our chefs are highly skilled because they have to take a very extensive and detailed four year course in cookie-baking before they can even set foot in our kitchen. Some techniques used by our chefs are so advanced and avant-garde that they are banned in certain countries like Uzbekistan. But when the freshly baked cookies come steaming out of the oven, they are most likely the best cookies you will ever get to taste.</p>

                        <h2>Ethics and sustainability</h2>
                        <p>When we started this restaurant we wanted it to not only produce the best tasting cookies, but also ensure that the farmers creating our ingredients were properly compensated for the time and hard work they put in to creating their produce. In order to ensure all our associates share our ideology, we spent a long time finding such partners. As such we can now confidently say all our business partners only participate in completely fair and ethical business and often times take great endeavors to ensure other companies understand the importance of properly compensating with whom they work.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, we made the same effort to ensure we have the smallest carbon footprint we could possibly have. We take climate change very seriously and we will do everything in our power to help fight it. We made sure all our partners share this opinion. We also help invest in the future of farming with a reduced impact on the climate, by supporting local charities of the farms we work with, that invest in new farming techniques which use less harmful products like fertilizer.</p>
