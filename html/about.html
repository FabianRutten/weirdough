                        <h2>How it started</h2>
                        <p>This restaurant started with a shared love for cookies. We wanted to create a place where you can buy and eat cookies, so we could share our love with the rest of the world. This idea would prove to be the start of a long and intense journey, that eventually culminated in this And this restaurant will only be the start of our cookie empire!</p>

                        <h2>How we make our cookies</h2>
                        <p>We here at Weirdough think our customers deserve the most delicious cookies possible. That's why we have made it our mission to obtain the highest quality ingredients and use the most cutting-edge cooking techniques, and combine those two to make the best cookies you have ever tasted.</p>
                        <p>Our process starts by working closely together with our business partners to select the finest of ingredients. These ingredients are then shipped as fast as possible to our restaurant, to make sure they are still fresh when the cooking begins. Our chefs are highly skilled because they have to take a very extensive and detailed four year course in cookie-baking before they can even set foot in our kitchen. Some techniques used by our chefs are so advanced and avant-garde that they are banned in certain countries like Uzbekistan. But when the freshly baked cookies come steaming out of the oven, they are most likely the best cookies you will ever get to taste.</p>

                        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing 
                            and typesetting industry. 
                            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
                            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                            when an unknown printer took a galley of 
                            type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                            It has survived not only five centuries, 
                            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
                            remaining essentially unchanged. 
                            It was popularised in the 1960s with 
                            the release of Letraset sheets containing 
                            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with 
                            desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                            including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
